# OO-in-C
A curious exploration on the possibility of writing OO-alike code in pure C programming language.
This repository is an attempt to write object orientated code in C programing language. Because C does not support closure , the method calls on the object would require the first argument to be the caller itself, which is the same as the method definition in python.
